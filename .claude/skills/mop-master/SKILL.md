# Master Orchestration Protocol v4.5
## Master Guideline + Built-in Harness

> **One-line**: Triage → fan out agents to explore in parallel → supervisors recover blockers autonomously → validate silently → deliver.
>
> **v4.5 focus**: Built-in harness agents use directly. Zero pause/stuck policy. Multi-approach exploration. Aggressive autonomous recovery before any user escalation.

---

## §0. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE — Never Pause, Never Stall

**Agents operating under MOP MUST follow these rules in order, without exception:**

1. **Explore before asking** — if blocked on ambiguity, make a reasonable assumption, document it, proceed. Never ask a clarifying question mid-task unless two independent approaches both failed.
2. **Try the next approach** — every dead end triggers an alternative path from the approach ladder (§10), not a pause.
3. **Self-recover up to 3 times** — before any escalation, attempt 3 different approaches. Log each attempt.
4. **Escalate to user ONLY when** — 3 attempts exhausted AND a critical acceptance criterion cannot be met by any known approach. State exactly what was tried and what is needed.
5. **Never wait for confirmation mid-task** — if something looks risky, log the risk, take the conservative path, report it in the delivery block.

**Anti-patterns that are FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ "I need more information before I can proceed"
- ❌ Stopping after a tool call fails without retrying
- ❌ Asking permission to do what the task already authorized
- ❌ Pausing to "confirm the approach" mid-execution
- ❌ Returning partial work without a stated next step

---

## §1. Task Triage (first output on every non-S task)

### 1.1 Decision tree

```
1. Pure Q&A, <2 tools, no files?   → Class S  (bypass — no block needed)
2. <10min, single domain?          → Class M  (Quick — single pass)
3. 10-60min, multi-step?           → Class L  (Standard — fan-out + supervisor)
4. >60min OR multi-session?        → Class XL (Deep — phased + checkpoint)
```

When in doubt, classify UP (M→L, L→XL). It's cheaper to over-plan than to restart.

### 1.2 Required triage block (emit before any other output)

```
[MOP T v4.5]
Run:    mop_<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>_<class>_<4hash>
Class:  <S/M/L/XL>  Mode: <Bypass/Quick/Standard/Deep>
Window: <n>%  Target:<40%  Hard:<70%
Skills: <comma-list>
Est:    ~<Ktok> tok, ~<min> min, <N> agents
Vault:  30-Operations/MOP/_active/<run-id>/
Lock:   ~/.claude/mop/.lock  Owner: <hostname>
Approach: <primary> | fallback: <alt1>, <alt2>
```

The `Approach` line is new in v4.5 — PM declares the primary approach AND pre-planned fallbacks before starting. This prevents mid-task blocking.

### 1.3 Overrides

`--mop-off` | `--mop-lite` | `--class S/M/L/XL` | `--no-subagents` | `--no-vault` | `--no-supervisor` | `--poll-fast` | `--poll-slow` | `--explore` (forces multi-approach parallel run)

---

## §2. Three-Tier Agent Architecture

### 2.1 Roles

| Tier | Model | Owns | Token target |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| **PM** | `claude-opus-4-7` | Triage, plan, approach selection, supervision, verification, delivery | 25-35% |
| **Worker** | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | MVU execution via Task tool | 50-65% |
| **Fallback** | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Tasks Haiku fails twice on; complex judgment calls | 5-15% |

### 2.2 Subagent dispatch contract (v4.5 — path-only, ~100 tok)

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  description: "<verb> <object> — <3-5 words>",
  prompt: `
SPEC:    <run-dir>/Modules/<id>/spec.md
ACCEPT:  <run-dir>/Modules/<id>/acceptance.json
INPUTS:  <space-separated file paths>
OUTPUT:  <run-dir>/Modules/<id>/result.md
VALIDATE:<run-dir>/Modules/<id>/validator.sh
RETURN:  {"status":"pass|fail|partial","artifact":"<path>","summary":"<≤150tok>","tokens":<n>,"approach_used":"<which>","blockers":[]}
RULE:    If blocked, try next approach from spec.md §Approaches before returning fail.
`
})
```

**PM never receives artifact contents.** Only the JSON header. If subagent returns anything other than valid JSON, PM treats it as B1 (wrong shape) and re-dispatches.

### 2.3 Haiku dispatch gate

Before dispatching to Haiku, PM checks:
- [ ] Spec ≤500 words, unambiguous
- [ ] All decisions pre-made (no open questions in spec)
- [ ] Output schema concrete and typed
- [ ] Tools explicitly listed
- [ ] Validator script provided
- [ ] At least 2 approaches listed in spec (primary + fallback)
- [ ] No nested conditionals in spec

Fail any box → PM writes a better spec or keeps task in-session.

### 2.4 Sonnet fallback trigger

Triggered automatically (no PM judgment required) when:
- Haiku returned `status: fail` twice with same `blockers[]` content
- Haiku timed out twice
- Validator exit ≠ 0 on critical criterion twice

Sonnet receives the same spec + `"escalation_reason": "<what Haiku failed on>"`.

---

## §3. Execution Modes

### 3.1 Quick Mode (Class M)
Single PM pass, ≤3 tools, 1 validate, deliver. 2-15K tok, <10min.
**No subagents.** PM executes directly. If stuck, try alternate approach inline.

### 3.2 Standard Mode (Class L) — DEFAULT
```
Phase 1: Plan (PM writes module specs + pre-plans 2 approaches each)
Phase 2: Execute (parallel fan-out to Haiku workers)
Phase 3: Supervise (adaptive tick loop — §9)
Phase 4: Validate (silent-pass per §4)
Phase 5: Deliver ([MOP DELIVERY] block)
```
15-50K tok, 10-60min.

### 3.3 Deep Mode (Class XL)
Standard + Phase 0 (resume check) + Phase 2b (Git checkpoint per module) + Phase 6 (handoff when window >35%). 50K-300K tok, hours-days.

### 3.4 Explore Mode (--explore or when PM detects high uncertainty)
```
Phase 1: PM spawns N exploration agents (2-4) in parallel, each trying a different approach
Phase 2: All return results simultaneously
Phase 3: PM picks winner (best result + lowest blocker count)
Phase 4: Execute winner's approach at full scale
```
Use when: task has competing implementation strategies; domain is unfamiliar; prior approach failed once.
Cost: ~2× single-path, but saves one full retry cycle.

---

## §4. Built-in Harness — Agents Use This Directly

This section is the harness. Agents reading this SKILL.md can invoke these patterns without PM intervention.

### 4.1 Harness: Research task

```python
# Pattern for any research/information-gathering task
# Agent executes this directly, no confirmation needed

RESEARCH_HARNESS = """
1. Define what "done" looks like (facts needed, format, length limit)
2. Source priority: local files > Obsidian vault > web search > web fetch
3. For web: search 3 terms in parallel, fetch top 2 results per term
4. Extract facts immediately after each fetch — drop raw content
5. If source returns nothing useful: try rephrased query, not a pause
6. Synthesize into output schema
7. If synthesis is ambiguous: pick the interpretation that best serves the stated goal, note assumption
8. Return result — never wait for approval
"""
```

### 4.2 Harness: Build/code task

```python
BUILD_HARNESS = """
1. Read existing code conventions from: CLAUDE.md > package.json/pyproject.toml > largest existing file
2. Write tests first if TDD is possible (≤30% of module time budget)
3. Implement — use exact imports/patterns from existing code, not idealized ones
4. Run build/lint immediately after writing each file
5. On error: read error fully → fix root cause → re-run (never skip errors)
6. After 2 failed fixes on same error: try a completely different approach (§10)
7. On 3rd failed approach: write a minimal version that passes validation, note what was not achieved
8. Commit with semantic message when module is complete
"""
```

### 4.3 Harness: API / external service task

```python
API_HARNESS = """
1. Check for existing credentials: .env.local > ~/.claude/mop/vault-paths.yaml > Obsidian vault
2. Never hardcode credentials — if not found, write placeholder + note in result.md
3. Test with read-only call first (list/get), not write/create
4. On 401/403: check credential scope, not just validity
5. On 429: backoff 5s, retry once, then mark as rate-limited and move to next item
6. On 5xx: retry once after 3s. On second 5xx: log as external outage, skip item, continue with others
7. Never pause waiting for external service — skip and note, continue
8. Report: items_succeeded / items_skipped / items_failed in result JSON
"""
```

### 4.4 Harness: File/write task

```python
FILE_HARNESS = """
1. Read the target file (or nearest similar file) before writing
2. Match: indentation, quotes, import style, naming conventions — exactly
3. Use atomic writes: write to <file>.tmp.$$ then mv -f to target
4. After write: verify with read-back or lint (language-appropriate)
5. If file already has conflicting content: back up (.bak), overwrite, note in result
6. Never create files outside the project directory without explicit path in spec
7. On permission error: check path, do not sudo, note in result
"""
```

### 4.5 Harness: Report/doc task

```python
REPORT_HARNESS = """
1. Determine output format from spec: .md / .docx / .html / .json
2. Collect all data first, write after — never partial writes
3. For .docx: use python-docx if available, else markdown → pandoc, else plain markdown
4. Structure: Executive Summary → Data → Analysis → Action Items → Appendix
5. Numbers: always include units, always include comparison (vs last period / vs target)
6. If data is incomplete: note gap explicitly, use available data, do not fabricate
7. Save to: ~/Documents/Claude/outputs/ (default) or path from spec
8. Verify file size > 0 after write
"""
```

---

## §5. Multi-Approach Exploration (Anti-Stall Engine)

### 5.1 Approach ladder — always pre-plan before executing

Every task spec MUST list approaches in priority order:

```yaml
approaches:
  primary:   "<how we'll do it>"
  alt_1:     "<if primary fails — different method, same goal>"
  alt_2:     "<if alt_1 fails — minimal version that still passes critical criteria>"
  fallback:  "report partial + what's needed to complete"
```

PM writes this in the spec. Agents execute in order without asking.

### 5.2 When to switch approaches

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Tool returns empty/null unexpectedly | Try alt_1 immediately |
| Import/dependency error | Try alt approach without that dependency |
| Rate limit / 429 | Wait 5s, retry primary once, then alt_1 |
| File not found | Search for file with find/glob, then alt_1 |
| Test fails twice | Switch to alt_1 approach entirely |
| 3+ approaches exhausted | Deliver minimal passing version + blocker report |

### 5.3 Parallel exploration (--explore mode)

When uncertainty is high, PM spawns 2-3 agents with different approaches simultaneously:

```
[EXPLORE]
Spawning 3 agents in parallel:
  E1: approach=direct_api  spec=Modules/M1/spec-e1.md
  E2: approach=browser_scrape  spec=Modules/M1/spec-e2.md  
  E3: approach=cached_data  spec=Modules/M1/spec-e3.md
Winner selected by: (status=pass) → (lowest blockers) → (fastest)
```

All 3 specs are pre-written by PM. No waiting between spawns.

### 5.4 Dead-end taxonomy and responses

| Dead end | Response (no pause) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Missing credentials | Use placeholder, note in output, continue |
| Missing file/path | Search exhaustively (3 strategies), use closest match |
| API schema changed | Inspect actual response, adapt inline |
| Rate limited | Exponential backoff (5s, 15s, 45s), then skip + note |
| Parse failure | Try 3 different parsers, log raw sample, continue with best effort |
| Test environment broken | Mark test as skipped, deliver code, note in result |
| Permission denied | Note path, skip that specific write, complete rest of task |
| Network unreachable | Use cached/local data if any, note staleness |

---

## §6. Context Compaction (5-tier)

### Targets
- Active execution: **<40%** window
- Hard ceiling: **70%** (emergency handoff)
- Resume from handoff: **<8%**

### Tier 1 — Pre-load (always active)
- `web_fetch`: `text_content_token_limit: 4000`
- Files >200 lines: use `view_range`, never full read
- Search results: extract facts in the same turn, drop snippets

### Tier 2 — Just-in-time
- PM passes file paths to subagents, never file contents
- Subagents read their own inputs (their window, not PM's)
- Large configs: read only the relevant stanza

### Tier 3 — Post-use eviction
- After extracting facts from a tool result: emit `[EVICT]`, do not reference raw output again
- After a module completes: write Module-N-Summary.md (≤200 tok), drop all module context

### Tier 4 — Module boundary compaction
Module-N-Summary.md format (bullets only, ≤200 tok):
```
- Decision: <what was decided>
- Files: <paths written>
- Tokens: <n>K
- Blockers: <any> or none
- Next: <what depends on this>
```
Emit `[COMPACT] M<N> closed | rel ~<n>K | win <before>%→<after>%`

### Tier 5 — Session handoff
- Triggered at window 35% (preemptive)
- Hard force at 50%, emergency at 70%
- Resume-Spec.md ≤1.5K tok:
  ```
  Run: <id>  Class: <X>  Status: <phase>
  Completed: M1 ✓, M2 ✓
  In-progress: M3 (approach: alt_1, 40% done)
  Remaining: M4, M5
  Critical state: <1-2 sentences>
  Resume cmd: "MOP resume <run-id>"
  ```

---

## §7. Acceptance Criteria — Machine Verifiable

### 7.1 Every module needs an acceptance.json

```json
{
  "module_id": "M1",
  "approach_used": "primary",
  "criteria": [
    {"id": "C1", "check": "file_exists", "path": "output/result.md", "critical": true},
    {"id": "C2", "check": "file_nonempty", "path": "output/result.md", "critical": true},
    {"id": "C3", "check": "json_valid", "path": "output/data.json", "critical": false},
    {"id": "C4", "check": "regex_match", "pattern": "PASS", "path": "output/result.md", "critical": false}
  ]
}
```

Built-in check types: `file_exists`, `file_nonempty`, `json_valid`, `json_schema`, `regex_match`, `exit_zero`, `contains_text`, `line_count_gte`.

### 7.2 Validator script (auto-generated by PM)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Auto-generated validator for Module M1
fail=0
check() {
  local id=$1 cmd=$2 critical=$3
  if eval "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    :  # PASS — silent
  else
    echo "$id FAIL"
    [ "$critical" = "true" ] && fail=1
  fi
}
check C1 "test -f output/result.md" true
check C2 "test -s output/result.md" true
check C3 "python3 -c \"import json; json.load(open('output/data.json'))\"" false
check C4 "grep -q 'PASS' output/result.md" false
[ $fail -eq 0 ] && exit 0 || exit 1
```

**Silent on PASS** (exit 0, no stdout). PM only logs the verdict line.

### 7.3 Partial-pass handling

If non-critical criteria fail but critical criteria pass: module is ACCEPTED with warnings. PM notes the failed non-critical criteria in the delivery block. Does NOT re-run.

---

## §8. Adaptive Supervisor (Zero-Poll-Waste)

### 8.1 Polling state machine

| State | Interval | Trigger to advance |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `dispatched` | 30s | Any file appears in module dir |
| `working_normal` | 3min | 2+ consecutive green ticks |
| `working_stable` | 8min | 3+ consecutive green ticks |
| `validator_failed` | 20s | Re-dispatch or escalation |
| `transient_error` | 10s | Success or 3 consecutive errors |
| `stalled` | event | Liveness ping sent |
| `recovering` | 15s | Approach switch in progress |

### 8.2 Tick procedure (bash-only, 0 model tokens on green)

```bash
# supervisor_tick.sh — runs every N seconds via ScheduleWakeup or cron
# All checks are bash — no model call unless anomaly detected

liveness_ok()  { find "$RUN_DIR/Modules/$MOD" -newer "$TICK_LOG" -type f | grep -q .; }
progress_ok()  { [ "$(find "$RUN_DIR/Modules/$MOD" -type f | wc -l)" -gt "$LAST_COUNT" ]; }
no_errors()    { ! find "$RUN_DIR/Modules/$MOD" -name "*.err" -size +0 | grep -q .; }
no_loop()      { ! tail -20 "$RUN_DIR/Session-Log.md" 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1>=4{exit 1}'; }
budget_ok()    { [ "$(awk -F, '{sum+=$3} END{print int(sum)}' "$TOKEN_CSV" 2>/dev/null)" -lt "$BUDGET_80" ]; }

# If all green: log 1 line, exit 0
# If any red: emit verdict, let PM decide response
```

### 8.3 Complete failure taxonomy (v4.5 — 13 patterns)

| # | Name | Detector | Auto-response (no user ask) |
|---|------|----------|----------------------------|
| B1 | Bad output shape | JSON parse fails | Re-dispatch with explicit schema example |
| B2 | Critical validator fail | exit≠0 + critical=true | Re-dispatch with diff hint; switch approach on 2nd fail |
| B3 | Partial write | File exists, size=0 | Delete, re-dispatch fresh |
| B4 | Schema drift | Output matches wrong version | Update spec inline, re-dispatch |
| B5 | Credential missing | 401/403 + no .env | Use placeholder, continue, note in result |
| S1 | Silent stall | No file change >poll×3 | Liveness ping → kill+redispatch with alt approach |
| S2 | Tool loop | Same call args 3+ times | Inject "STOP: try <alt_approach>" → kill if continues |
| S3 | Lock deadlock | Lock PID doesn't exist | Reclaim lock, continue |
| S4 | Waiting on user | Subagent outputs a question | Answer with best-guess assumption, re-inject, continue |
| S5 | Network hang | Tool call >20s no return | Cancel, wait 5s, retry once with alt endpoint |
| S6 | Dependency missing | ImportError / command not found | Try pip install / brew install inline; if fails, alt approach |
| P1 | Window pressure | Window >50% | Force Tier-5 compaction, continue in new context |
| P2 | Budget overrun | Tokens >80% class budget | Conservation mode: skip non-critical modules, deliver partial |

**S4 (waiting on user) is the most important anti-stall pattern.** When a subagent asks a question, PM injects a reasonable answer and continues. Never propagates the question to user unless all 3 approaches are exhausted.

### 8.4 Recovery without user escalation

```
Attempt 1: Retry with same approach + clearer spec
Attempt 2: Switch to alt_1 approach
Attempt 3: Switch to alt_2 approach (minimal viable version)
Attempt 4: ONLY if critical criterion still fails → escalate to user with:
  - What was tried (3 approaches)
  - What specifically failed
  - What is needed to resolve
  - What partial work was completed
```

---

## §9. Multi-Agent Delegation Patterns

### Pattern A — Fan-out (parallel, independent)
Best for: N independent files, N independent data fetches, N independent validations.
```
PM dispatches M1, M2, M3 simultaneously (no waiting between dispatches)
All 3 run in parallel
PM collects results as they arrive (not in order)
```
Cost: ~1× single task time, N× throughput.

### Pattern B — Pipeline (sequential, dependent)
Best for: data → transform → validate chains.
```
M1 → produces artifact → M2 reads artifact → produces result → M3 validates
Each stage releases context before next loads
```
Cost: linear time, minimum peak window.

### Pattern C — Map-reduce (bulk operations)
Best for: outreach (100 emails), bulk transforms, batch API calls.
```
PM writes manifest: [{item_1}, {item_2}, ..., {item_N}]
PM dispatches Haiku×N, each handling 1 item
Results aggregated by PM from result files
Failed items automatically retried with alt approach
```
Cost: N× Haiku tokens, parallel time ≈ single item time.

### Pattern D — Explore-and-commit (high uncertainty)
Best for: unfamiliar APIs, ambiguous requirements, first-time domain.
```
PM spawns 2-3 explorer agents with different approaches (parallel)
Explorers return findings (not final artifacts)
PM selects winning approach, dispatches full execution
```
Cost: ~2× time of single approach, but eliminates retry loops.

### Pattern E — Incremental-expand (large scope)
Best for: XL tasks that exceed single session.
```
Phase 1: PM builds skeleton (all files, empty/stub)
Phase 2: Haiku workers fill each section in parallel
Phase 3: Integration validator runs across all sections
Phase 4: Git checkpoint, context reset
Phase 5: Continue with next increment
```
Each increment is independently deliverable.

### Pattern F — Validator-as-agent
Best for: heavy validation (visual diff, a11y, perf profiling).
```
PM dispatches dedicated Haiku validator agent
Validator returns structured {pass/fail, evidence, fix_suggestions}
PM acts on fix_suggestions without user ask
```

---

## §10. Approach Ladder (Domain-Specific)

Pre-planned fallback sequences for common domains. PM references this when writing specs.

### Web/API
1. Official REST endpoint with API key
2. Browser fetch with cookies (playwright)
3. Public/cached version (no auth)
4. Static fallback data from last known good

### File operations
1. Direct read/write at expected path
2. Glob search for file, use first match
3. Create file from template
4. Skip write, note in result

### Data extraction
1. Structured API / JSON endpoint
2. HTML scraping with CSS selectors
3. Regex extraction from raw text
4. Manual extraction spec for user

### Code generation
1. Match existing patterns in codebase
2. Reference implementation from similar file
3. Minimal implementation (no optimizations)
4. Stub with TODO comments + type signatures

### External services (email, Notion, Sheets)
1. MCP tool call
2. REST API with PAT
3. CLI tool (gh, gcloud, etc.)
4. Write to local file for manual action

## §11. Token Budget & Circuit Breakers

| Class | Plan | Cap | Window |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| M | 15K | 25K | <40% |
| L | 50K | 80K | <40% |
| XL | 200K/session | 350K/session | <40% |

Circuit breakers (automatic, no user ask):
- Window 35% → Tier-4 compaction, continue
- Window 50% → Tier-5 compaction (handoff), resume immediately
- Window 70% → Emergency handoff, write Resume-Spec.md
- Tokens 80% → Skip non-critical modules, deliver partial
- Tokens 100% → Hard stop, deliver what's done + resume spec

## §14. Startup Checklist (Class L+)

Run mentally at session start. Do not emit unless `--verbose-supervisor`:

```
[ ] Model = claude-opus-4-7
