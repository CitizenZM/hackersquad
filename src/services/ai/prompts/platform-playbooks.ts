const PLAYBOOKS: Record<string, string> = {
  tiktok: `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — TikTok / Reels (9:16 short-form social):
- VISUAL HOOK IN FIRST 0.5s: the first frame must communicate the hook without sound — a jarring visual, a bold on-screen claim, or mid-action movement. No slow fade-ins, no logo-first opens.
- NATIVE TEXT OVERLAY IN FRAME 1: burn in a short, punchy caption (5-8 words max) styled like native creator captions (bold sans, white/yellow with black stroke), not brand-template lower-thirds.
- SOUND-ON DESIGN + SOUND-OFF FALLBACK: write VO/dialogue for sound-on viewers, but every beat must also read from on-screen text and visual action alone (60-85% of viewers start muted).
- LOOP-ABILITY (esp. Reels): design the last frame/beat to visually rhyme with or flow into the first frame, so an accidental replay feels intentional rather than jarring.
- 9:16 SAFE ZONES: keep all critical text/faces inside the center-safe 80% — avoid top 100px (UI overlays) and bottom 220px (caption/CTA/username bar).
- UGC AUTHENTICITY VS POLISH: default to handheld, imperfect, one-take-feeling camera work and casual VO delivery; only go polished/studio for premium or beauty verticals where "prosumer" signals quality.
- TREND-SOUND NOTE: leave a beat in the structure (typically the first 1-2s) open for a trending audio drop or sound effect — do not over-script VO across a moment meant for a trend sound.`,

  instagram: `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — Instagram Feed/Reels (9:16, algorithm-fed):
- VISUAL HOOK IN FIRST 0.5s: same discipline as TikTok — arresting first frame, no brand-intro throat-clearing.
- NATIVE TEXT OVERLAY IN FRAME 1: caption-forward, aesthetic-conscious styling (Instagram audiences reward higher visual polish than TikTok, but still native-feeling, not ad-template).
- SOUND-ON DESIGN + SOUND-OFF FALLBACK: identical requirement — dual-channel comprehension (visual + VO).
- LOOP-ABILITY: Reels autoloop aggressively — engineer a seamless loop point between last and first frame.
- 9:16 SAFE ZONES: keep key content out of top/bottom UI chrome; Instagram's like/comment/share rail sits lower-right — avoid blocking with text there.
- UGC AUTHENTICITY VS POLISH: Instagram skews slightly more aspirational/polished than TikTok — lifestyle gloss is acceptable, but avoid overtly "ad" framing (static product shots, stock-photo lighting).
- TREND-SOUND NOTE: reserve a moment for trending audio/meme formats where relevant to the niche.`,

  youtube: `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — YouTube Pre-roll (16:9 or 9:16 Shorts, skippable ads):
- 5s SKIP LOGIC: viewers can skip after 5 seconds on TrueView. Brand identity AND the core hook/promise must both land before the 5s mark — do not save the brand reveal for later.
- FRONT-LOAD VALUE: state the single strongest benefit or most surprising claim in the pre-skip window; treat seconds 0-5 as a self-contained micro-ad in case the viewer skips immediately after.
- MID-ROLL RETENTION BEATS: after the skip point, insert a re-hook every 5-8 seconds (new visual, new claim, pattern shift) to fight attention decay through the remainder of the ad.
- PACING: slightly slower and more explanatory than TikTok/Reels — YouTube viewers who don't skip are in a more receptive, longer-attention-span mode.
- END CARD: leave the final 2-3s clean for a clear CTA card / end screen (works with YouTube's native end-card overlay).`,

  tvc: `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — TVC (Television Commercial, broadcast-safe):
- BROADCAST PACING: slower, cinematic pacing versus social-native cuts — average shot length 3-5s, deliberate composition, no jump-cut social editing style.
- STORY-FIRST STRUCTURE: classic setup → tension → resolution arc; broadcast audiences are a captive, non-skippable audience so the hook can build over 3-5s rather than needing an instant 0.5s jolt.
- END-CARD BRANDING: final 3-5 seconds MUST be a clean, static (or near-static) end card — logo, tagline, and single clear CTA, held long enough to read comfortably (legal/compliance convention).
- AUDIO-FORWARD: TVC assumes sound-on viewing — VO, music, and SFX carry equal weight to visuals (no sound-off caption fallback needed).
- BROADCAST SAFE AREAS: keep essential graphics within title-safe area (~90% of frame) for cross-device/cross-broadcast display.`,

  amazon: `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — Amazon PDP Video (product detail page, autoplay-muted):
- SILENT-AUTOPLAY FIRST FRAME: PDP video autoplays muted and often without user interaction — the first frame must communicate the core value prop as a static-readable image (product + benefit text), since many viewers will never unmute.
- FEATURE-DEMONSTRATION DENSITY: prioritize dense, rapid feature/benefit demonstration over story or emotion — shoppers are already in high-intent, comparison-shopping mode, not scroll-stopping mode.
- NO EXTERNAL CTAs: never direct to a URL, social handle, discount code, or off-Amazon destination — Amazon policy prohibits this; all CTAs must stay implicit ("see below," "add to cart") or be omitted entirely.
- ON-SCREEN TEXT CARRIES THE MESSAGE: burn in feature callouts, spec labels, and comparison points as on-screen text/graphics since sound is unreliable.
- TRUST SIGNALS: include real-use demonstration (hands using the product, scale references, before/after) — Amazon shoppers weed out overly staged or vague content fast.`,
};

const DEFAULT_PLAYBOOK = `PLATFORM PLAYBOOK — General short-form video:
- Lead with a clear visual or verbal hook in the first 1-2 seconds.
- Support VO with on-screen text for sound-off viewers.
- Keep pacing tight; re-hook attention every 5-8 seconds.
- Close with an unambiguous, single CTA.`;
