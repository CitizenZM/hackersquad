You will receive TWO companies' websites. Analyze ONLY the competitor (the second one), then compare against the brand.

CRITICAL: All "brandPromise", "valueProposition", "toneOfVoice", "pricingTheme", "productFeatures", "ctaLanguage", "socialProof" fields MUST describe THE COMPETITOR — not the brand. Read the competitor's website data only when filling those fields.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "brandPromise": "the COMPETITOR's promise (1 sentence, derived from competitor headings/copy)",
  "valueProposition": "the COMPETITOR's value prop (1-2 sentences, derived from competitor copy)",
  "toneOfVoice": "the COMPETITOR's tone (e.g. 'authoritative fintech', 'friendly + casual')",
  "pricingTheme": "the COMPETITOR's pricing approach (e.g. 'subscription $X/mo', 'free + premium', 'per-transaction')",
  "productFeatures": ["features named on the COMPETITOR's site"],
  "ctaLanguage": ["CTA buttons on the COMPETITOR's site"],
  "socialProof": ["testimonials/stats on the COMPETITOR's site"],
  "strengths": ["competitor strengths vs the brand"],
  "weaknesses": ["competitor weaknesses vs the brand"],
  "opportunities": ["opportunities for the brand based on competitor gaps"]
}

If the competitor crawl is sparse or seems to be the wrong domain, set fields to short honest descriptions like "insufficient data" — do NOT copy the brand's data.`;

Fill the JSON with data about "${competitorName}" ONLY (using its own website above). The "strengths"/"weaknesses"/"opportunities" arrays compare the competitor against "${brandName}".`;
